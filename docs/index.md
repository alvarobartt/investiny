# 🤏🏻 `investpy` but made tiny

Suuuuuuuper simple and tiny `investpy` replacement while I try to fix it! Here I'll try
to add more or less the same functionality that was developed for `investpy` while keeping this
package tiny and up-to-date, as some solutions just work temporarily.

Everyone using `investiny` please go thank @ramakrishnamekala129 for proposing this solution
that seems to be stable and working fine so far (fingers crossed!). Also take the chance to explore
any other solution proposed by the `investpy` users at https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy/issues.

I'm currently waiting to have a conversation with Investing.com so as to see whether we can get
to some sort of an agreement in order to keep `investpy` alive.

In the meantime you can follow me at https://twitter.com/alvarobartt as I post updates there, and
I highly appreciate your feedback.

@adelRosal, an `investpy` user created a change.org site so as to show some support, so please sign
the petition as it may be useful towards the continuity of `investpy` at https://www.change.org/p/support-from-investing-com-for-the-continuity-of-investpy-library

Finally, remember that `investiny` is super simple and tiny and shouldn't be considered reliable, it's
working fine so far, but it may be discontinued, so please use it carefully.
